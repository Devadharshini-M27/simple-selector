    <h2>Python</h2>
    <p id="para">Python is a versatile, high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and ease of use.<br> It's widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, and software development, among other fields. <br>Python's popularity stems from its simple syntax, which emphasizes code readability, <br>and its extensive libraries and frameworks that simplify complex tasks. 
        Key Features and Characteristics</p>

    <h2>Development of Python</h2>
    <p1 class="para1"><center>Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language,<br> and he first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.<br> Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, <br>was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions.<br> Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python<br></p1>

    <h2>Python & AI</h2>
    <p2><center>AI researchers are fans of Python. Google TensorFlow, as well as other libraries (scikit-learn, Keras), <br>establish a foundation for AI development because of the usability and flexibility it offers Python users.<br> These libraries, and their availability, are critical because they enable developers to focus on growth and building.<br></p2>
